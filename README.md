As a gamer who largely plays RPG games, I'm a big fan of Pok√©mon games. So to learn how web scraping works in Python, I decided to create something practical and relevant to my interests. This command-line program asks users for the name of a Pokemon, and then attempts to return information about where that Pokemon is located based on data it scrapes from the Internet. The site it scrapes data from is a popular independently maintained all-things-Pokemon database site, [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/).

Requirements to run locally:
* Working Internet connection
* Python 3.x installed (ideally 3.6+)
* 'Requests' module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests (install with 'pip install requests')
* 'Beautiful Soup 4' module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4 (install with 'pip install beautifulsoup4')

This application is free to use or be built on in any reasonable way for personal/non-commercial use. Just be careful with web scraping too hard, too often--it counts as site traffic!
